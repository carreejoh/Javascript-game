# Javascript-game
A website designed to test your knowledge of JavaScript and compare previous results.

# Description 
This site uses eventlisteners to change the question and log whether the user selected the incorrect or correct answer. Incorrect answers subtract time from the clock, while correct answers add 10 points. The site also saves those scores and initials to local storage. As of right now nothing calls on the local storage to display said answers. I keep screwing it up and should be adding the initials and score to an array but I'm quitting for now as I just cannot figure it out.
